<h2>Our Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable<br />
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in<br />
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or<br />
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions<br />
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or<br />
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,<br />
threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces<br />
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of<br />
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail<br />
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed<br />
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be<br />
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>
<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be<br />
reported by contacting the project team at <a href="mailto:wuhongxu1208@gmail.com">wuhongxu1208@gmail.com</a>. All<br />
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that<br />
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is<br />
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.<br />
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>
<p>Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good<br />
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other<br />
members of the project's leadership.</p>
